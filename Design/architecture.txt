The game has 3 layers.

The top layer has the UI / user interface.
    Any delays are here, not delays caused on server.
The middle layer has the application logic.
    The application logic includes the players dice
    The interface for the top layer should be a Game struct / object
The lower layer has the raw data.
    The raw data is the players, the player names, their current bid.

Communication through the layers should be event / message based where possible.
