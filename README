LiarsDiceLib 
============

A Python library for the implementation of the game Liars Dice with no user
interface components.

The doc folder contains a bunch of basic design documentation such as the
projects goal and basic architecture.

The src folder contains a single python module called game.py that
does all the cool stuff, a unit test module (game_test.py) and an integration
test module (game_integration_test.py).
The run_all_tests.py module is a convience function to run both the unit tests
and integration tests in a single action.

To perform tests you will need Michael Foord python mock library available
at http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/mock/ in your module space.
