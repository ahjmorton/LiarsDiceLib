LiarsDiceLib 
============

A Python library for the implementation of the game Liars Dice with no user
interface components.

The doc folder contains a bunch of basic design documentation such as the
projects goal and basic architecture.

The src folder contains a number of python modules that implement
the game rules with extension points to addtional rules for varients.
The primary interface that external code will interact with is the 
Game interface in game.py and GameView in game_views.py.

There is simple sample of a running game showing the expected output
of a game as well as a unit test suite with integration test that
tests everything except GameView

The run_all_tests.py module is a convience function to run both the unit tests 
and integration tests in a single action.

To perform tests you will need Michael Foord python mock library available
at http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/mock/ in your module space.
